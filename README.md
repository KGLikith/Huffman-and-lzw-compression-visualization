## Compression Algorithms

### Huffman Coding

**Huffman Coding** is a **lossless data compression algorithm** based on character frequencies. It builds a binary tree (Huffman Tree) where:
- Characters with higher frequencies have **shorter binary codes**
- Characters with lower frequencies have **longer binary codes**

#### Features of Huffman Coding
- ðŸ“Š **Frequency-Based**: Uses the frequency of each character to build an optimal prefix tree
- ðŸŒ² **Binary Tree Construction**: Dynamically builds a tree where each leaf is a character
- ðŸ”— **Prefix-Free Codes**: No code is a prefix of another; ensures unambiguous decoding
- ðŸ’¡ **Greedy Algorithm**: Always combines the two least frequent nodes
- ðŸš€ **Efficient for texts with skewed frequency distribution**

### Lempelâ€“Zivâ€“Welch (LZW) Compression

**LZW** is a **dictionary-based** lossless compression algorithm. It works by:
- Scanning sequences of characters
- Storing new sequences in a **dynamic dictionary**
- Replacing repeated sequences with **dictionary indexes**

#### Features of LZW Compression
- ðŸ“˜ **No Need to Transmit Dictionary**: Both encoder and decoder build it identically on the fly
- ðŸ§± **Efficient for Repeating Patterns**: Great for structured, repetitive data (e.g., XML, logs)
- ðŸ”„ **Dynamic Dictionary Building**: Grows during encoding, allowing for efficient handling of long strings
